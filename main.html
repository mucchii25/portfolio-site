    <h2>Portfolio: My Café Branding Journey</h2>
  
    <section class="background">
      <h3>1. Background of My Experience</h3>
      <p>My parents have run a cozy community-based and japaenese traditional café(kissa) of continuing over 45 years in a non-urban area of Japan. During university breaks, I actively supported its rebranding by creating marketing strategies rooted in traditional values while introducing a modern perspective. This experience gave me deep insight into customer needs, seasonal product development, and local engagement.</p>

      <h3>2. Logo Design</h3>
      <p>This logo was designed to reflect a sense of simplicity and warmth, using earth tones and organic shapes inspired by the café's natural surroundings.</p>

      <h3>3. First Menu Attempt</h3>
      <p>I initially created a menu design that did not resonate well with the target audience due to unclear product focus and mismatched design elements. This taught me the importance of aligning visuals with customer expectations.</p>

      <h3>4. Research-Based Menu Innovation</h3>
      <p>Based on customer demographic research, I developed new dessert concepts tailored to 40-60 yeas women customers, especially those who visit on weekends. This included seasonal sweets and visually appealing layouts optimized for social media sharing.</p>

      <h3>5. My Current Aspiration</h3>
      <p>Through this journey, I realized the power of storytelling and design in café marketing. I aim to further enhance my skills in digital marketing, especially SNS strategy and analytics, to help small businesses like my family's café grow sustainably in the digital era.</p>
